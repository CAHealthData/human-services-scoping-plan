## Problem Statement
It's hard to find accurate, complete, updated information about the human services available in a community. While there are many formal and informal systems set up to provide this information to community members who urgently need it, the systems are redundant and non-interoperable. As a result, the services a client is made aware of can vary depending on which "door" they use to approach the system, and the information they are given may be out of date and incorrect by the time they receive it. The higher the error rate and inefficiency of the system potential clients must navigate, the more likely they will not access the services they need when they need them and will not have their problems addressed. Additionally, system redundancy increases total maintenance cost, makes it harder for service providers to address complex client needs, and reduces the ability of policymakers, funders, and researchers to evaluate program effectiveness and community health.

## Background and the Existing Environment
The existing system of human services information and referral has grown over many years of effort by multiple parties, and the options available to help-seekers have increased markedly over time. Following is a brief overview of some of the components of the existing system. Additional information on how these components are implemented in California is located in the [Data Ecosystem Analysis] section of this report.

### Information and Referral Providers
- Call Centers
- Websites
- Paper Directories
- Informal Networks

### Service Taxonomies
- AIRS Taxonomy
- Open Eligibility

### Database Schema
- AIRS Resource Database Standard
- schema.org for Public Civil Services
- National Information Exchange model
- Human Services Data Specification

## Needs Assessment
As the previous section makes clear, a robust ecosystem of solutions has grown up around human service information and referral. However, users note a number of inefficiencies and failings of the current system, and many have ideas for its improvement.

### System User Interviews

- Small nonprofit-run programs can quickly appear, be defunded, and disappear.
- Keeping information updated is "the biggest challenge of all time", as providers tend to be focused on the "human" part of the services.
- Out of date info creates the impression a service is unreliable.
- E.g. single mother with three kids and no childcare has to take the bus with all three to access resources. Any incorrect info that causes her to make unnecessary trips is truly a hardship.
- State program details can be hard to get, finding a knowledgable contact is hard.

### CWDA Member Survey
Through a partnership with the California Welfare Directors Association, we surveyed county human services department staff throughout the state on their experiences both providing and accessing information on human services in their communities. We received 27 responses from 22 of California's 58 counties. Highlights of their responses include:

- The vast majority (74%) indicate that county case managers use their personal knowledge and/or lists to refer clients to services not provided by the county. A smaller majority (63%) indicate they also use 2-1-1, and a bare majority (52%) indicate that their county has an internal resource directory system.
- While the average satisfaction with the accuracy of the information available about other community resources among respondents was moderately high (averaging 3.63 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 was "not satisfied", 3 was "ambivalent", and 5 was "very satisfied"), satisfaction with the currency of that data (i.e. how "up to date" it is) was lower, averaging 3.27 on a scale of 1 to 5.
- The majority indicated that the general public or other service providers get information about their services from a county-produced resource, such as the county's website (78%) or some other brochure or directory (59%). Just 56% indicated that these parties get information on county services from 2-1-1, and just 44% indicate they get information from another externally produced directory.
- A majority (71%) indicate that external referral providers get updated information about the county's programs by contacting the county on a periodic basis, while fewer than half (42%) indicate they proactively contact such referral providers when their information changes.
- Highlights from open-ended question:
  * 6 indicated there should be a new centralized location for data, while 8 responses made clear they assumed 2-1-1 was the centralized resource. One stated there should be a central statewide resource to facilitate finding information for clients moving between areas.
  * 7 stated onus should be on service providers to update own data (with 2 stating specifically that providers should be able to directly change their data in the system), while 2 indicated the central source should survey. 3 indicated that updates should be more frequent without naming the responsible party.
  * 5 stated there should be more resources made available for updating data
  * Other responses included better websites and other electronic tools for providing information to clients, including more refined search capabilities, calls to release their internal service databases publicly, and better training for referral staff.
