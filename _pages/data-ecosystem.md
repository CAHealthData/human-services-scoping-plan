## County Public Data System Vendor Inventory

California's 57 counties offer human services information on a wide variety of open data portals, 211 search tools, and geographical information system (GIS) portals, along with countless ad-hoc offline services. The majority (62%) of these public data systems, however, are operated by three vendors: Socrata, iCarol, and Esri. 

### County Open Data Portals 

Open data portals, which offer datasets and APIs from various county departments freely to the public, typically include some human services datasets. Although only 11 California counties have some form of open data portal, seven of these (totalling 44% of the state's population) have a portal operated by Socrata. Other county portals are operated by Accela, Junar, NuCivic, and OpenGov.

### 211 Systems

211 systems offer human services directory information by phone and online. 37 California counties have an operational 211 system, of which 29 use a system built on iCarol referral and helpline software. Other counties offer 211 services from Bowman Systems, Eden I&R, ReferWeb, and Visionlink. Los Angeles and San Mateo counties have their own proprietary 211 systems. 

### GIS Portals

GIS portals offer digital maps, some of which provide layers containing human services location data. 37 California counties have a GIS portal, of which 17 have a portal built on Esri technology. Other counties offer portals from CalCAD, GISCloud, and SimpleLayers. Many counties have their own ad-hoc portals.

### Discussion

Because there are relatively few major vendors among California county open data, 211, and GIS portals, partnering directly with these vendors to access data offers an alternative to coordinating between multiple counties. Partnering primarily with vendors has many benefits: 
- Pre-existing APIs and other data pathways
- Low barrier to entry for counties with same vendor
- Fewer points of contact
- Easier access to technical collaborators
- Easier access to county data inventories
